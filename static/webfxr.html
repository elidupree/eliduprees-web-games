    <p>Notes for audio nerds:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>"Volume" is measured in decibels of amplitude above -40, because positive numbers are easier to work with. (Normally, 0.0 dB represents the maximum amplitude of 1.0, but here, 40.0 dB represents that.)</li>
    <li>Sine waves and square waves are normalized to have the same root-mean-square. A full-scale sine wave is 40.0 dB on the volume scale, while a full-scale square wave would actually be ~43 dB on this scale.</li>
    <li>When using harmonics, the Nth harmonic is given an amplitude of 1/N compared to the first harmonic.</li>
    <li>Fractional values of "harmonics" linearly attenuate the last harmonic, so that the effect is continuous. Values lower than 1.0 behave the same as 1.0.</li>
    <li>"Waveform skew" also functions as square duty. However, it goes through a logistic function first, so that you never run into the ends of the scale.</li>
    <li>The flanger doesn't have any feedback, it's just a sum of two copies of the signal with an offset. The input is called "frequency" – the reciprocal of the offset – so it can intuitively be on a log scale like the others.</li>
    <li>For the low-pass and high-pass filters, Bfxr used first-order digital RC filters. I always felt like the rolloff wasn't steep enough, so I chained 3 of them together, creating an amplitude rolloff of 30 dB per decade (equivalently, a power rolloff of 60 dB per decade).</li>
    <li>Bitcrush resolution reduction uses a novel formula for fractional bits to make the effect continuous. If it's between B bits and B+1 bits, it uses B+1 bits, but the rounding has a fractional bias towards even numbers. (Notice that a complete bias towards even numbers is the same as using one less bit.) I also tried a different method, where I used normal rounding and the possible sample values were 2^bits distance away from each other (using the fractional value of bits), but that didn't sound quite as continuous during a slide, despite being more elegant in some ways.</li>
    <li>The envelope doesn't <em>exactly</em> determine the length of the sound. Chorus, flanger, and bitcrush frequency can make the sound slightly longer, because the envelope is applied first, and those can make the sound linger.</li>
    </ul>
